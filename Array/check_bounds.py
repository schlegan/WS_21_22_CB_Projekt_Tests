# Checkbounds can be proven by running:
# gcc runtime.o ~/path_to_repo/tests/mytests/check_bounds.s
# and then ~/path_to_repo/a.out
# and typing e.g. 5 or -1 (which is 1 over the maximal index and 1 beneath the
# minimum index 0) as soon as it's possible to type sth in
# But the x86 instructions executing the check can anyways be seen in check_bounds.s
